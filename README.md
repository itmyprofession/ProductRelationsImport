Full description will follow.
All you need to know for now is that this Magento extension allows you to import via manual input or file import the product relations:
 - Related products  
 - Up-sells  
 - Cross-sells.  

Uninstall:
---------
Remove the following files and folders:  

 - app/code/community/Easylife/Relations/  
 - app/design/adminhtml/default/default/template/easylife_relations/tooltip.phtml  
 - app/etc/modules/Easylife_Relations.xml  
 - app/locale/en\_US/Easylife\_Relations.csv  

Conflicts:

The extension does not rewrite any core class so it shouldn't conflict with other extensions.
